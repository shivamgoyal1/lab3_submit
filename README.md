#Lab 3 - CS52
##Shivam Goyal

This lab 3 is a sticky note application, where one can create a note by entering title and clicking create (or pressing enter). One can also go about edit and delete the note. One can also resize the note by dragging the note from bottom right corner. I've also incorporated zIndex, that allows for the note to come in front.

The extra credit I've attempted is:
1) Incorporating zIndex: I.e. the clicked note comes to front
2) Resizing of Notes
3) New notes are created at a slight offset from the original note, so that notes are not stacked on creation.
